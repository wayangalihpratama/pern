# PERN (Postgress - Express - React - Node)
- Try to learning use Express JS as backend with Postgress as database and React as frontend. Will try to implement electron js to launch this project as desktop application.

## Start
### Backend

- After installing nodemon globally, go to backend folder then `yarn install` & `./start.sh`
