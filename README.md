# PERN (Postgress - Express - React - Node)

- Try to learning use Express JS as backend with Postgress as database and React as frontend. Will try to implement electron js to launch this project as desktop application.

---

## Start

### Development

- Require nodemon to start express backend
- Running on port `5000`
- `.env` just for learning (just random string), not an secret env

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

- After installing nodemon globally, you can run the development apps with below comand:
  - `yarn start-dev` to run as web application
  - `yarn start-electron-dev` to run as desktop application
